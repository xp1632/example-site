What's need to be done:

 - printing function on briefPage, 
 - combination of our nav bars(I think yours is prettier but Iâ€˜ve fix the mobile side menu button so maybe you can combine them)
 - Fix the description button so it didn't change oddly sometimes
 - jumping to home page,about page, gallery page etc
 - add nav bar to about page, gallery page
 - font stuffs on different screen size
